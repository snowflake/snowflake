I'm currently working on submitting a bug report to Grandstream
regarding their implementation of Prefer IPv6 and Prefer IPv4 modes on some of their phones, particularly my GRP2612.

For details, see [Grandstream Network Protocol Prefer Mode](https://github.com/snowflake/grandstream-prefer-ipv6-bug/wiki) Wiki here on Github.
